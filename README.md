# File Renamer

> **Rename files based on a text file**

This idea was originated when I downloaded multiple video lectures and happened that their names were not properly configured.

The videos were named with the following pattern:
- video1.mp4
- video2.mp4
- ...
- video160.mp4

Luckily enough, there was a text file provided with all the names inside, one name per line.

So the script was created to avoid renamining all the video files manually, by extracting them from the text file.
